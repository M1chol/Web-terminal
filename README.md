# Web-terminal
Very basic implementation of command prompt into web using HTML, css and JavaScript. Original version uses php server to store login information, if you want to get it working you would have to set up custom database. Data is not hashed and php code is vulnerable to sql injection, so don't use it as example. If you want to see a preview version it's on this google site:
